# Operating Systems
This repository contains laboratory exercises from the course [Operating Systems](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/opesys) at FER.

## About
An operating system is a set of programs that act as an intermediary between a user of a computer, the computer hardware and the applications programs. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.

## Learning Outcomes
- write an multithreaded program and program which creates multiple processes
- sdemonstrate how interrupt service routine works
- apply synchronization mechanisms
- list components of operating system kernel
- analyze deterministic and non-deterministic task system behaviour
- list and explain CPU scheduling algorithms
- employ memory allocation mechanisms
- explain demand paging
- develop file-system functions
